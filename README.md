# GameMaker
This is a two-week project that I was a part of in Fall 21 during Gregory Rawlins's P532 Object Oriented Software Design course.
I forked it here after we finished the project and I had to part ways with the codebase so that I could finish it myself.
At least 80% of the code here is entirely mine. I was responsible initally for the model, then I was responsible for the controller, too, and then I had to bulldoze the entire view in one all-nighter before the presentation with one other member. 

All that I need to do to get it working is to touch up the view a bit and it will be a fully functional game maker for simple little games. This project heavily uses the following design patterns: MVC, composite, strategy, observer
